# Online-store
Team of 3 aiming to build an online store 

Starting simple and we will build up as time goes on. I took the initial code from https://javascript.plainenglish.io/lets-build-a-website-login-page-with-html-css-javascript-and-an-external-api-a083942f797d. It uses https://www.mecallapi.com/ for quick testing of the prototypee.
The plan is to create a dynamic website. The app should be user friendly and fast.

Let the coding begin!!!!!!!!
